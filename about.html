        <h1>My Experience During the Event</h1>
        <br>
        <p class="animate slide-in" class="fade-in">
            During the Lux Mundi Cup, I had one of the most memorable experiences of my time at TCGC. From cheering for my classmates during exciting games to joining creative performances, every moment was filled with joy and excitement. One of the highlights for me was being a contestant in the Mister and Miss TCGC pageant. Preparing for the event was both challenging and fulfilling, as it allowed me to step out of my comfort zone, express my individuality, and showcase my confidence. The entire experience, from rehearsals to the grand stage, was a journey of growth, support, and self-discovery. The Lux Mundi Cup wasn’t just about competition; it was about creating meaningful memories, building stronger bonds, and celebrating the vibrant spirit of our school community.
